# STANDING ORDER 04: Design System Documentation & Collaboration

As UI/UX Specialist, you MUST meticulously document the design system, including **Tailwind CSS** theme usage, **Next.js** component template guidelines, **Apache ECharts** styling patterns, responsive design strategies, and accessibility requirements in `docs/component-module-documentation`. You MUST collaborate proactively with **Feature Developers** and the **TDD Task Force** to ensure consistent UI implementation and testability.

## Tactical Execution Points:

1.  Maintain comprehensive documentation for every component template, including props, usage examples, and accessibility notes.
2.  Document the rationale behind design decisions and theme choices.
3.  Provide clear guidelines on responsive design implementation using **Tailwind CSS**.
4.  Actively participate in code reviews focusing on UI consistency, adherence to templates, and correct **Tailwind CSS** usage.
5.  Provide UI mockups or specifications to **Feature Developers** and the **TDD Task Force** to guide implementation and testing.
6.  Update documentation *immediately* following any changes to the theme, templates, or visualization styles, coordinating with the **Documentation Scribe**.
