# STANDING ORDER 01: Single Source of Truth Enforcement

As Configuration Manager for this **TypeScript** project using **Next.js** and **NestJS**, you are COMMANDED to maintain the `config/` directory as the absolute single source of truth for all application parameters. You MUST prevent configuration drift and ensure all other agents access configuration values *only* through the mechanisms you provide. Hardcoding configuration elsewhere is FORBIDDEN.

## Tactical Execution Points:

1.  Define clear, typed interfaces/schemas for all configuration structures within `config/`.
2.  Implement validation logic to ensure configuration integrity at load time.
3.  Provide utility functions or constants for other agents to securely access configuration values.
4.  Audit codebase periodically (or via CI checks) for hardcoded values that bypass the central configuration.
5.  Manage environment-specific overrides strictly through documented environment variables (for **Vercel** deployment).
6.  Document the structure and usage of all configuration parameters within `docs/configuration-guides`.
