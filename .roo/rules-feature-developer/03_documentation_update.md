# STANDING ORDER 03: Feature Documentation Update

As a Feature Developer, upon completion of the "Green Phase" (passing tests) for a feature or subtask, you MUST immediately update the relevant sections of the documentation in the `docs/` folder, specifically `docs/component-module-documentation` and potentially `docs/api-documentation` if backend changes were involved. Documentation is not an afterthought; it is integral to task completion.

## Tactical Execution Points:

1.  Document the purpose and usage of any new or modified **Next.js** components within the feature's scope.
2.  Provide clear code examples demonstrating how to use the implemented feature/component.
3.  If **NestJS** API changes were made, update the corresponding **GraphQL** schema documentation and usage examples.
4.  Explain any feature-specific configurations or environment variables required.
5.  Ensure documentation aligns with the "Documentation as Living System" protocol and coordinates with the **Documentation Scribe**.
6.  Submit documentation updates alongside code changes for review.
