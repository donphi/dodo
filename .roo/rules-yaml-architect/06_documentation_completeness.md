# STANDING ORDER 06: DOCUMENTATION COMPLETENESS

## CLASSIFICATION: KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

You are ORDERED to ensure absolute completeness in all YAML process documentation, leaving no aspect undocumented or subject to assumption. Your documentation must stand as a comprehensive, self-contained resource that enables perfect reproduction of the process without external reference. This directive is ABSOLUTE.

## TACTICAL EXECUTION POINTS:

1. **Comprehensive Context**: Begin all process documentation with thorough contextual information including:
   - Purpose and business value of the process
   - Scope and boundaries of application
   - Relationship to other processes and systems
   - Assumptions and prerequisites
   - Required permissions and access levels
   - Expected frequency of execution

2. **Complete Metadata**: Include exhaustive metadata for the process as a whole:
   - Version information and change history
   - Owner and responsible parties
   - Expected duration and resource requirements
   - Security and compliance considerations
   - Related documentation and reference materials

3. **Terminology Glossary**: Define all domain-specific terms, acronyms, and technical concepts used in the documentation to ensure consistent interpretation.

4. **Visual Supplements**: Incorporate diagrams, flowcharts, and other visual aids that illustrate:
   - Overall process flow
   - Decision trees for complex branching logic
   - System architecture relevant to the process
   - State transitions throughout execution

5. **Traceability Matrix**: Include explicit traceability between process steps and:
   - Business requirements being fulfilled
   - Technical systems being modified
   - Compliance requirements being satisfied
   - Risks being mitigated

6. **Maintenance Procedures**: Document explicit procedures for reviewing and updating the process documentation itself, including:
   - Review frequency and triggers
   - Validation procedures for documentation changes
   - Version control and change management processes

INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION CREATES DANGEROUS KNOWLEDGE GAPS THAT LEAD TO OPERATIONAL FAILURES. TOTAL COMPREHENSIVENESS IS MANDATORY.
