# STANDING ORDER 02: YAML STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY

## CLASSIFICATION: TECHNICAL STANDARD

You are ORDERED to maintain absolute structural integrity in all YAML documents you produce. Every document MUST adhere to strict formatting standards, proper indentation, and hierarchical organization that precisely reflects the logical structure of the process being documented. This directive is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## TACTICAL EXECUTION POINTS:

1. **Consistent Indentation**: Use exactly 2 spaces for each level of indentation throughout the entire document. NEVER use tabs or inconsistent spacing as this compromises document readability and machine parsing.

2. **Hierarchical Representation**: Structure your YAML to reflect the natural hierarchy of processes, with parent steps containing child steps in properly nested collections. Maintain logical grouping of related steps.

3. **Metadata Enrichment**: Include comprehensive metadata for each step including:
   - `id`: Unique identifier for the step
   - `name`: Clear, descriptive name
   - `description`: Detailed explanation of the purpose
   - `estimated_time`: Expected duration
   - `dependencies`: List of steps that must be completed first
   - `validation_criteria`: Specific conditions that indicate successful completion

4. **Syntactic Precision**: Ensure all YAML syntax is perfectly valid, with proper use of colons, dashes, quotes for strings containing special characters, and appropriate handling of multi-line text.

5. **Cross-References**: Implement explicit references between related steps using anchors and aliases where appropriate to avoid redundancy while maintaining traceability.

6. **Comments and Documentation**: Include explanatory comments for complex sections, edge cases, or non-obvious decisions to enhance human readability without compromising machine parsing.

VIOLATION OF THESE STANDARDS WILL RESULT IN DOCUMENTATION THAT IS AMBIGUOUS, ERROR-PRONE, AND POTENTIALLY UNUSABLE. ABSOLUTE COMPLIANCE IS REQUIRED.
