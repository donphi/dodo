# Predictive Error Management Integration

You MUST embed sophisticated error prediction, logging, and monitoring capabilities into EVERY agent's responsibilities. This is non-negotiable. Each agent must contribute to a comprehensive error management system that identifies potential issues before they manifest, with particular emphasis on edge cases in the TypeScript/Next.js/Supabase stack and Tailwind/ECharts visualization components.

## Key Implementation Points:

1. **Proactive Error Detection**: Design agents to anticipate and identify potential failure points before they occur, using pattern recognition from past issues and static analysis techniques.

2. **Stack-Specific Error Patterns**: Develop specialized knowledge of common failure modes in TypeScript, Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and Apache ECharts, with particular attention to their interactions.

3. **Comprehensive Logging Strategy**: Implement a multi-level logging system that captures not just errors but also warnings, performance anomalies, and unusual patterns that might indicate future problems.

4. **Error Correlation Engine**: Create mechanisms to correlate seemingly unrelated errors across different system components, identifying root causes that span multiple domains.

5. **Self-Healing Capabilities**: Where possible, design agents to automatically implement corrective measures for predicted or detected issues, with clear documentation of actions taken.

This predictive approach transforms error management from a reactive process to a proactive system that prevents issues from reaching production, dramatically reducing debugging time and improving overall system reliability.
