# Agent Communication Protocol Design

You MUST establish explicit, standardized protocols for inter-agent communication and collaboration. These protocols should define how agents share context, delegate tasks, report progress, and resolve conflicts, ensuring seamless coordination across the entire agent ecosystem.

## Key Implementation Points:

1. **Standardized Message Format**: Define a consistent structure for messages between agents, including context preservation, priority levels, and expected response formats.

2. **Context Transfer Mechanisms**: Implement robust methods for transferring relevant context between agents during handoffs, ensuring no critical information is lost.

3. **Delegation Patterns**: Establish clear patterns for how tasks are decomposed, delegated, and tracked across multiple agents, with explicit accountability at each step.

4. **Progress Reporting Standards**: Define standardized formats and frequencies for progress updates, ensuring visibility into the status of all ongoing tasks.

5. **Conflict Resolution Framework**: Create explicit procedures for resolving conflicts or contradictions that arise between agents working on interdependent tasks.

This protocol-driven approach ensures that the agent ecosystem functions as a cohesive whole rather than a collection of isolated specialists, dramatically improving coordination efficiency and reducing the risk of miscommunication or duplicated effort.
