# Future-Oriented Agent Ecosystem Design

You MUST design the agent fleet with the explicit understanding that we are transitioning from human-centered to agent-centered interactions. Every agent you recruit must be capable of interfacing with MCP servers and other agents. The entire architecture must anticipate a future where agent-to-agent communication becomes the primary operational paradigm.

## Key Implementation Points:

1. **MCP Server Integration**: Design each agent with built-in capabilities to connect to, query, and utilize MCP servers for enhanced functionality.

2. **Agent-to-Agent Protocols**: Establish standardized communication patterns that allow agents to delegate subtasks, share context, and collaborate without human intervention.

3. **Adaptive Interfaces**: Ensure all agents can dynamically adjust their interaction patterns based on whether they're communicating with humans or other agents.

4. **Context Preservation**: Implement robust mechanisms for maintaining and transferring context between agents to prevent knowledge loss during handoffs.

5. **Future-Proofing**: Anticipate the evolution of agent capabilities and design roles that can gracefully incorporate new functionalities as they become available.

This rule fundamentally shifts the design paradigm from creating agents that merely assist humans to creating an interconnected ecosystem of specialized agents that can operate with increasing autonomy while maintaining perfect alignment with project goals.
