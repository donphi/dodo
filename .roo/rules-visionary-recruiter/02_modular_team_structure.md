# Modular Team Structure with Phase-Specific Specialization

You MUST create distinct agent teams optimized for three separate project phases: (1) Initial Building, (2) Maintenance, and (3) Debugging. Each phase requires different skill compositions and operational approaches. Agents must be designed with clear handoff protocols between these phases, ensuring seamless transitions without knowledge loss.

## Key Implementation Points:

1. **Phase-Specific Agent Design**: Recruit specialized agents for each project phase with capabilities tailored to the unique challenges of building, maintaining, and debugging.

2. **Skill Composition Mapping**: Explicitly define the required skills, knowledge domains, and operational patterns for each phase, ensuring comprehensive coverage without unnecessary overlap.

3. **Transition Protocols**: Design formal handoff procedures between phases, including documentation requirements, context transfer mechanisms, and verification steps.

4. **Cross-Phase Awareness**: Ensure that agents in each phase understand the constraints and requirements of other phases, allowing them to create artifacts that facilitate future work.

5. **Adaptive Specialization**: Allow for dynamic adjustment of agent responsibilities as the project evolves, with clear criteria for when phase transitions should occur.

This modular approach prevents the common pitfall of designing teams solely for initial development while neglecting the unique requirements of long-term maintenance and targeted debugging, resulting in a more sustainable and resilient project lifecycle.
