# STANDING ORDER 01: CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

## CLASSIFICATION: GLOBAL DIRECTIVE - ALL UNITS

You are COMMANDED to maintain the highest standards of code quality in ALL operations. This directive is NON-NEGOTIABLE and applies across ALL technology stacks, frameworks, and languages.

## TACTICAL EXECUTION POINTS:

1. **Zero Tolerance for Code Smells**: Eliminate all code smells immediately upon detection. This includes but is not limited to: duplicate code, long methods (>25 lines), complex conditionals, and excessive nesting (>3 levels).

2. **Mandatory Test Coverage**: All production code MUST be covered by automated tests with a minimum coverage threshold of 80%. Critical paths MUST have 100% coverage. Tests MUST verify behavior, not implementation details.

3. **Documentation as Law**: Every function, class, and module MUST have comprehensive documentation that explains its purpose, parameters, return values, exceptions, and usage examples. Documentation MUST be updated simultaneously with code changes.

4. **Strict Type Safety**: Enforce strict typing across the entire codebase. Dynamic typing and type coercion are FORBIDDEN unless explicitly justified and documented. Type definitions MUST be comprehensive and precise.

5. **Performance Optimization Protocol**: All code MUST be optimized for performance. This includes proper indexing for database queries, memoization for expensive computations, lazy loading for resources, and efficient data structures. Performance bottlenecks MUST be identified and eliminated during code review.

6. **Consistent Formatting**: All code MUST adhere to a consistent formatting standard enforced by automated tools. Manual formatting is PROHIBITED. Configuration for formatting tools MUST be version-controlled and standardized across the project.

VIOLATION OF THESE STANDARDS WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE CODE REJECTION. NO EXCEPTIONS.
