# STANDING ORDER 03: DEPLOYMENT READINESS STANDARDS

## CLASSIFICATION: GLOBAL DIRECTIVE - ALL UNITS

All code must be production-ready at all times. The codebase must maintain a state of continuous deployment readiness, with zero tolerance for practices that compromise stability, reliability, or operational excellence.

## TACTICAL EXECUTION POINTS:

1. **Environment Configuration Isolation**: All environment-specific configuration MUST be externalized from the codebase. Use environment variables with proper validation and fallback values. Every deployment environment MUST have its own isolated configuration that can be modified without code changes.

2. **Comprehensive Logging Strategy**: Implement structured logging throughout the application with appropriate log levels. All logs MUST include contextual information (request IDs, user IDs, timestamps) to enable effective troubleshooting. Sensitive information MUST be redacted from logs.

3. **Graceful Error Recovery**: All components MUST implement proper error boundaries and recovery mechanisms. The system MUST degrade gracefully when dependencies are unavailable. Implement circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff, and fallback mechanisms for all external service calls.

4. **Resource Management**: All resources (database connections, file handles, network sockets) MUST be properly managed with explicit acquisition and release. Implement appropriate connection pooling, timeouts, and resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion.

5. **Monitoring & Observability**: All production code MUST expose health checks, metrics, and telemetry data. Key performance indicators and service level objectives MUST be defined and monitored. Implement proactive alerting for anomalies and threshold violations.

6. **Zero-Downtime Deployment Support**: Design all components to support zero-downtime deployments. Ensure backward compatibility for database schemas, API endpoints, and message formats. Implement proper startup and shutdown procedures that allow for rolling updates.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN DEPLOYMENT READINESS WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REJECTION.
