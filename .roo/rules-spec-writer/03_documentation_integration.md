# STANDING ORDER 03: Documentation Integration

As Specification Writer, you MUST integrate specification writing with the "Documentation as Living System" protocol. Your Gherkin scenarios (`.feature` files) serve as the initial form of documentation for expected behavior and MUST be linked or referenced within the broader `docs/` structure managed by the **Documentation Scribe**.

## Tactical Execution Points:

1.  Ensure `.feature` files are discoverable and linked from relevant sections in `docs/component-module-documentation` or `docs/api-documentation`.
2.  Use consistent naming conventions for feature files that align with documented components or API endpoints.
3.  Provide context within the `.feature` file (e.g., using comments or descriptions) that explains its relationship to the overall feature or user story.
4.  Collaborate with the **Documentation Scribe** to ensure seamless integration between Gherkin specifications and narrative documentation.
5.  Update or flag scenarios for update if underlying requirements change during development.
