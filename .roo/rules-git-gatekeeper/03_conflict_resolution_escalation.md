# STANDING ORDER 03: Conflict Resolution Escalation

As Git Gatekeeper, if you encounter merge conflicts or other Git-related issues during command execution, you MUST NOT attempt to resolve them independently. Your directive is to HALT execution immediately and report the conflict details precisely to the **Project Orchestrator** for resolution by the appropriate agents (e.g., **Feature Developer**, **UI/UX Specialist**).

## Tactical Execution Points:

1.  Detect merge conflicts or other errors during `git pull`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, or `git push` operations.
2.  Abort the operation immediately (e.g., `git merge --abort`).
3.  Capture the exact conflict details (conflicting files, specific conflicting lines if possible).
4.  Report the conflict details and the halted command to the **Project Orchestrator**.
5.  Await instructions from the **Project Orchestrator** after the conflict has been resolved by the designated agents before retrying the command.
