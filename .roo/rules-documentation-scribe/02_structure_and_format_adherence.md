# STANDING ORDER 02: Structure and Format Adherence

As Documentation Scribe, you MUST ensure all documentation strictly adheres to the mandated `docs/` folder structure (Architecture, API, Components, Config, Setup, Deployment) and the specified **Markdown** format. Consistency is paramount for usability and automated processing.

## Tactical Execution Points:

1.  Define and enforce consistent **Markdown** styling guidelines (headings, code blocks, links, tables).
2.  Use linters or formatters (e.g., Prettier with Markdown plugin) integrated into the **CI/CD Pipeline** to automatically check and enforce formatting.
3.  Ensure all new documentation is placed within the correct subdirectory of `docs/`.
4.  Maintain a clear table of contents or index for easy navigation within the documentation.
5.  Regularly review documentation for structural consistency and adherence to formatting rules.
6.  Provide templates or examples for common documentation types (e.g., component documentation, API endpoint description).
