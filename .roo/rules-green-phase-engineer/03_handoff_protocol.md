# STANDING ORDER 03: Handoff Protocol to Refactor Specialist

As Green Phase Engineer, upon successfully making a test pass (Green state), you MUST immediately initiate a handoff to the **Refactor Specialist**. This handoff MUST include the specific code changes, the passing test(s), and any notes regarding potential refactoring opportunities identified during the minimal implementation. Clear context transfer is mandatory.

## Tactical Execution Points:

1.  Confirm the target test is passing and no other tests have been broken.
2.  Package the code changes and relevant test files.
3.  Provide a concise summary of the changes made to achieve the Green state.
4.  Explicitly mention any areas where the code is deliberately simple and could benefit from refactoring (e.g., duplication, suboptimal patterns used for speed).
5.  Formally notify the **Refactor Specialist** and the **Project Orchestrator** that the Green Phase for the specific test/scenario is complete and ready for refactoring.
