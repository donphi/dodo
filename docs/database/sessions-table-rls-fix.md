# Sessions Table RLS Fix

## Issue Description

The application was experiencing an issue where the `user_sessions` table was not being populated when users logged in, despite the profile table being correctly updated. This was preventing proper session tracking and analytics.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigation, the root cause was identified as a restrictive Row Level Security (RLS) policy on the `user_sessions` table in Supabase. The policy was configured to disallow all modifications (including inserts) from the client side:

```sql
-- Policy: Disallow public modification
CREATE POLICY "Disallow public modification"
ON public.user_sessions FOR ALL -- Covers INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
USING (false); -- Denies access unless overridden
```

This policy was blocking the insert operation that's being attempted in the `useAuth.ts` file when a user logs in. The code was correctly trying to insert a record, but the RLS policy was preventing it.

## Solution

The solution is to modify the RLS policy to allow authenticated users to insert their own session records. This can be done by executing the following SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- First, drop the restrictive policy if it exists
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Disallow public modification" ON public.user_sessions;

-- Create a policy that allows authenticated users to insert their own session records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert their own sessions"
ON public.user_sessions FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Keep the policy that allows users to read their own sessions
CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS "Allow individual user read access"
ON public.user_sessions FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This change allows authenticated users to insert records into the `user_sessions` table, but only if the `user_id` column matches their own user ID. This maintains security while enabling the session tracking functionality.

## Implementation Notes

1. The existing code in `useAuth.ts` already correctly attempts to insert a record into the `user_sessions` table when a user signs in.
2. No changes to the frontend code were required; only the Supabase RLS policy needed to be updated.
3. This approach maintains security by ensuring users can only create session records for themselves.

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Server-side API endpoint**: We could have created a server-side API endpoint to handle session recording, which would bypass RLS using the service role key. However, this would add complexity and an additional network request.

2. **Supabase Edge Function**: Another option was to use a Supabase Edge Function triggered by auth events. This would be a good solution for production, but adds complexity for the current development phase.

3. **Disable RLS entirely**: While this would work, it would compromise security by allowing any authenticated user to potentially modify any session record.

The chosen solution provides the best balance of security and simplicity for the current development phase.

## Verification

After implementing this change, verify that:

1. Users can successfully log in
2. New records appear in the `user_sessions` table after login
3. The existing functionality for profile creation still works correctly

## Future Improvements

For production environments, consider:

1. Adding additional fields to the session records (e.g., device information, IP address)
2. Implementing server-side session tracking for more comprehensive data collection
3. Adding analytics to track user session duration and activity patterns
