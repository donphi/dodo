# Frontend UI Fixes

## Dashboard Mobile View Improvements

### Issue 1: Profile Icon Size Consistency
- **Problem**: The circle around the user profile icon in the dashboard mobile view was too large compared to desktop view.
- **Solution**: Reduced the profile icon size in mobile view from `size-10` to `size-8` to maintain consistency with desktop view.
- **File Modified**: `frontend/components/dashboard/single_page.tsx`

### Issue 2: Theme Switcher Positioning
- **Problem**: The theme switcher was not appearing next to the profile icon in mobile view when clicked.
- **Solution**: Modified the theme switcher in mobile view to:
  - Show/hide based on the disclosure state (open/closed)
  - Position it with `mr-4` (same as desktop) to the left of the profile icon
  - Properly structure the component hierarchy for correct behavior
- **File Modified**: `frontend/components/dashboard/single_page.tsx`

### Issue 3: Mobile Menu Functionality
- **Problem**: After initial changes, the mobile menu was not appearing when clicking the profile icon.
- **Solution**: Fixed the structure of the Disclosure component to properly connect:
  - Properly nested the render prop function within the main Disclosure component
  - Ensured the DisclosurePanel is correctly connected to the DisclosureButton
  - Maintained the theme switcher visibility tied to the open state
- **File Modified**: `frontend/components/dashboard/single_page.tsx`

These changes ensure a consistent user experience between mobile and desktop views of the dashboard, with proper functionality of both the theme switcher and mobile menu.
