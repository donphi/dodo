# Visualization Color Scheme Update

This document records the color scheme changes made to the TidyTree and RadialTidyTree visualization components.

## Overview

The color scheme for both the TidyTree and RadialTidyTree visualizations has been updated to use a new set of colors that better support both light and dark modes. The changes include:

1. Using #4f46e5 (indigo) as the root node color
2. Replacing yellow nodes with #F5E100 (dark mode) and #E6D300 (light mode)
3. Replacing blue/cyan nodes with #00F583 (dark mode) and #00D975 (light mode)
4. Using #d8dbe2 as the grey in light mode and #69635C in dark mode

## Detailed Color Mapping

| Node Type | Previous Color | New Color (Dark Mode) | New Color (Light Mode) |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Root      | #a855f7 (Purple) | #4f46e5 (Indigo)   | #4f46e5 (Indigo)      |
| Category  | #38bdf8 (Blue)   | #00F583 (Green)    | #00D975 (Green)       |
| Field     | #facc15 (Yellow) | #F5E100 (Yellow)   | #E6D300 (Yellow)      |
| Other     | #999 (Gray)      | #69635C (Gray)     | #d8dbe2 (Gray)        |

## Implementation

The color scheme changes were implemented in:

1. `frontend/components/TidyTree.tsx`
2. `frontend/components/RadialTidyTree.tsx`

The implementation ensures that the appropriate colors are used based on the current theme (dark or light mode).

## Visual Impact

The new color scheme provides several benefits:

1. **Better Contrast**: The new colors provide better contrast in both dark and light modes, improving readability and accessibility.
2. **Theme Consistency**: Colors now adapt appropriately to the current theme.
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: The color choices maintain a clear visual hierarchy, making it easy to distinguish between different types of nodes.
4. **Aesthetic Improvement**: The new colors create a more cohesive and modern look for the visualizations.

## Future Considerations

For future color scheme updates, consider:

1. Extracting colors to a centralized theme configuration file
2. Adding support for user-customizable color schemes
3. Implementing color schemes that account for color blindness and other accessibility concerns
